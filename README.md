## UDOT-23.206 2024 Utah Winter Roadway Maintenance Study

This repository contains data and scripts associated with the "Developing snow performance measures for public information" research project, funded by the Utah Department of Transportation as project UDOT-23.206, and carried out by [Patrick Singleton](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/singleton-patrick) and [Shailendra Khanal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shailendra-khanal/) of the [Singleton Transportation Lab](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/research/labs/patrick-singleton/index) at Utah State University. 

* **Objectives**
    * To understand what factors influence public satisfaction with winter road maintenance (WRM) practices.
    * To understand how people make transportation choices during snowy weather. 
* **Methods**
    * An online survey of 568 Utah residents across six geographic regions, during two winter storms in 2024.
    * Data from the Utah Department of Transportation's Road Weather Information System.
    * Ordered and binary logit models, analyzing satisfaction with WRM and travel behavior during storms.
